# Flashbot experiments

A collection of experimental code to interact with Ethereum network and play with Flashbot API using some Smart Contracts.

## Experiment 1: Waste Gas

- Create & Deploy a simple smart contract to waste all the gas from an incoming transaction so that it can be picked up by Flashbot's miners
- Create a simple script which interacts with the just created Smart Contract to check everything is up and running
